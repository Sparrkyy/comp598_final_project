1465454028582637573,17891410,2021-11-29 22:54:01+00:00,@Jdlazo From the description Disney posted about adding Hawkeye and Kate to Campus, it did sound like it would take place where the prior Black Widow show was, by the Quinjet, the Avengers Assemble show. I don't believe Shang-Chi has had a show, just walking on the top level waving.

I could see him being a big bad. And since he's likely coming relatively soon they could cast for him. https://t.co/ajMQzQ75iB
